Eric's [new site](https://ericjaszkowiak.netlify.app)

To get started, make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), clone the repo and `cd` into the repo.

`npm install` to install dependencies

`npm run start` to start dev server at localhost:3000

`npm run dev:css` to compile scss into css and get some fancy styles

And then you're off at the races 🐎

Make lots of changes, fix lots of bugs
